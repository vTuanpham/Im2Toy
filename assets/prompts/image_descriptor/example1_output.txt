Example: A small, rustic wooden cabin sits nestled at the edge of a dense pine forest. The cabin's dark brown wooden walls are worn and weathered, with visible cracks and chips in the wood from years of exposure. A single stone chimney protrudes from the roof, with wisps of light gray smoke lazily rising into the clear sky. The roof itself is covered in dark green moss, clinging to the old shingles in patches. Surrounding the cabin are tall, towering pine trees, their needles a deep, rich green, swaying gently in the soft breeze. Dappled sunlight filters through the trees, casting a patchwork of light and shadow on the ground, which is covered in fallen pine needles and soft patches of grass. A narrow dirt path, well-trodden and slightly curved, leads up to the front door of the cabin, where a small, weathered wooden sign hangs, swinging slightly in the breeze.
