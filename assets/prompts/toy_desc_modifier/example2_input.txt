Original Description: A shiny red bicycle rests against a park bench in the middle of a quiet park. The bench is old, its wooden slats chipped and worn. Nearby, a large oak tree provides shade, and the grass is lush and green. A winding path leads through the park, and the sunlight filters through the leaves of the trees.
