Modified Toy-Alike Description: Captured against a pure white background, Adventure Buddy Benny the Bicycle brings joy with every wheel spin! This cheerful 6-inch tall collectible is molded in the sweetest candy-apple red with pearl shimmer finish that catches light like morning dew. Benny's personality shines through their expressive face - two large headlights serve as eyes, complete with star-shaped reflections and friendly painted eyelashes, while their handlebar forms an encouraging smile decorated with a tiny bell that really rings!
Instead of traditional chrome, Benny's accents are finished in rainbow pearl that creates magical color shifts as they move. Their seat is covered in what looks like soft leather in caramel brown, decorated with tiny embossed hearts. The wheels, made from special soft-touch material, spin smoothly and feature translucent star patterns that catch the light. A cute basket at the front holds their best friend - a removable plush puppy named Spoke who loves going on adventures!
