Original Description: A small, rustic wooden cabin sits at the edge of a dense pine forest. The cabin's walls are worn and weathered, with visible cracks and chips. A single stone chimney protrudes from the roof, with light gray smoke rising into the clear sky. The roof is covered in dark green moss, and tall pine trees surround the cabin. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting shadows on the ground covered with pine needles and grass. A narrow dirt path leads up to the cabin.
