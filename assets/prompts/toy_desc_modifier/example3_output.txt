Modified Toy-Alike Description: Standing sweetly against a pure white background, Lighthouse Lucy the Guardian rises 12 inches tall on her rounded cloud-like base. Her tower is crafted from smooth, pearl-white plastic with a gentle shimmer, featuring subtle textures that make her look huggably worn. Lucy's face shows her caring personality with two large, twinkling windows as eyes, decorated with tiny painted eyelashes, and a cheerful curved railing forming her smile, complete with adorable rosy cheeks. Her top hat-like dome is finished in candy-apple red with a soft metallic sheen, housing a warm, rotating night-light that gives off a cozy glow perfect for bedtime. Around her middle, she wears a decorative "belt" of tiny sculpted hearts and stars. The base resembles fluffy clouds rather than harsh rocks, painted in soft grays and whites with a pearlescent finish that sparkles gently in photos. Lucy comes with a special "friend" - a tiny magnetic seagull that can perch anywhere on her surface, making her never feel lonely. When her light is activated by a heart-shaped button at the back, she plays a soft, gentle lullaby.
