Modified Toy-Alike Description: Photographed against a pure white background, Cozy Cottage Cabby stands adorably at 8 inches tall, ready to welcome friends to their magical forest home. This huggable habitat is crafted from smooth, warm-toned plastic with a gentle wood-grain pattern that feels inviting to touch. Cabby's cheerful face features two round, crystal-clear windows as eyes, decorated with tiny painted curtains that look like fluttering eyelashes, while the arched door forms a friendly smile complete with rosy wooden cheeks. Their removable roof is specially textured to look like a fluffy moss blanket in the softest shade of spring green, topped with a little silver chimney that puffs out gentle cotton-like clouds when you press a hidden button!
The entire cottage measures 6 inches wide by 5 inches deep, with rounded corners and soft edges throughout. Cabby's window shutters open and close with a gentle click, revealing tiny shelves of painted cookies inside - they love baking for their forest friends! The front door has a heart-shaped handle and opens to reveal a cozy interior with depicted furniture stickers. The base resembles a patch of magical forest floor, with molded flowers and mushrooms in pastel colors. A tiny magnetic squirrel friend named Nutty can stick anywhere on Cabby's surfaces, keeping them company. When you press a hidden button on the back, Cabby plays a soft, soothing forest melody that's perfect for bedtime.
